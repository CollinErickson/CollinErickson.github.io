      <description>Code Snippets are a useful feature of RStudio that many people don’t know about. The RStudio Blog post gives good instructions on how they can be used, but I thought I’d share how I use them.
Here are some of the ways I use snippets:
Loading Magrittr One of my favorite R functions is the pipe operator, %&amp;gt;%, from the Magrittr package. There’s already a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+Shift+M, for this function.</description>

      <description>Recently I’ve been running computationally intensive simulations that take up to six hours each. This is prohibitively slow, and is assuredly suboptimal since I coded it all, so I decided to do a time profile evaluation to find the bottlenecks in the code. This is easily done in R using the eponymous function from the package profvis.
The following example shows how to use profvis.</description>
