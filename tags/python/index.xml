      <description>One of the main reasons I strongly prefer R to Python is thatRStudio is far better than all Python IDEs I have used.I usually use Spyder for my Python IDE, but it has a lotof shortcomings compared to RStudio.
RStudio has added some Python support, for example in Rmarkdownfiles, in the past.Recently I discovered the R package reticulate which is closelyintegrated with RStudio and lets you run Python code more easilyin RStudio.</description>
