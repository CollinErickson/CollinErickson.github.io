      <description>I had never heard of spectral clustering until last week. Then I came across this image comparing 9 clustering algorithms on different 2D datasets.
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_001.png&amp;quot;) It appeared to me that spectral clustering did the best across all the data, and I realized that the only clustering algorithm I understood was k-means. (DBSCAN might be better based on the results shown, but one step at a time.) So here Iâ€™m going to try to figure out what spectral clustering is and how I can implement it.</description>
