      <description>One of the main reasons I strongly prefer R to Python is that RStudio is far better than all Python IDEs I have used. I usually use Spyder for my Python IDE, but it has a lot of shortcomings compared to RStudio.
RStudio has added some Python support, for example in Rmarkdown files, in the past. Recently I discovered the R package reticulate which is closely integrated with RStudio and lets you run Python code more easily in RStudio.</description>
