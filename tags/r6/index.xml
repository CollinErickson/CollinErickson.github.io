      <description>I’ve used R6 classes in a lot of my R projects in recent years. They are easier to understand than S3 and S4 objects if you’ve ever done programming with objects in other languages. I also am still not sure how I can have functions act on data in an S3 object. I think it’s not possible, but I’m really not sure. And R6 classes are definitely better than RC objects.</description>
