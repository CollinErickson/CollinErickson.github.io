      <description>I’m going to start digging into baseball statistics.There are a couple of R packages that facilitate the collecting of datafrom MLB.I’ll be using the R package mlbgameday, mostly because I saw that it wasrecently updated.
Getting some dataFirst we load the package.Along with a couple of other of packages that we’ll need.
library(mlbgameday)library(dplyr)## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;:## ## filter, lag## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;:## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, unionlibrary(ggplot2)library(magrittr)Now we’ll grab some data.</description>
