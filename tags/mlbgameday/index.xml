      <description>Recently I was reading about pitchers having no control over results of a ball in play.This is the main idea behind FIP/DIPS.This goes against the common idea that pitchers can be good if they induce weak contact.I’m going to investigate this in this post.
Similar to last time, I’m using the same data from mlbgameday.

      <description>I’ll be continuing on from the last post.
Load packages first.

      <description>I’m going to start digging into baseball statistics.There are a couple of R packages that facilitate the collecting of datafrom MLB.I’ll be using the R package mlbgameday, mostly because I saw that it wasrecently updated.
Getting some dataFirst we load the package.Along with a couple of other of packages that we’ll need.
library(mlbgameday)library(dplyr)## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;:## ## filter, lag## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;:## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, unionlibrary(ggplot2)library(magrittr)Now we’ll grab some data.</description>
